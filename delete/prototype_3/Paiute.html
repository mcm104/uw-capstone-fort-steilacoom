      <h1>Paiute</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Refers to three non-contiguous groups of indigenous peoples of the Great
         				Basin. Although their languages are related within the Numic group of Uto-Aztecan
         				languages, these three groups do not form a single set. The term "Paiute" does
         not
         				refer to a single, unique, unified group of Great Basin tribes.</p>
