      <h1>Catholicism</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Core beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic
         				Church teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church founded
         by
         				Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the successors of
         				Christ's apostles, and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter, upon whom
         				primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ.</p>
