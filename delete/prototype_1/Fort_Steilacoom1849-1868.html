      <h1>Fort Steilacoom (1849-1868)</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Founded by the U.S. Army in 1849 near Lake Steilacoom, among the first
         				military fortifications built by the U.S. north of the Columbia River in what
         was to
         				become the State of Washington, the fort was constructed due to civilian agitation
         				about the massacre in 1847 at the Whitman (Waiilatpu) mission.</p>
